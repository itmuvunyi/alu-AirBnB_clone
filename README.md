# HBnB üè†

**HBnB** is a complete web application that integrates database storage, a back-end API, and a front-end interface in a clone of AirBnB. This project is the first step toward building a full web application. It includes a custom command-line interface (CLI) for data management and base classes for data storage.

## Project Description
HBnB allows users to manage objects (e.g., users, places, etc.) through a command-line interface. It simulates key functionalities of AirBnB, storing data persistently and providing an interactive way to manipulate it.

---

## Command Interpreter
The CLI is accessed via the `console.py` file. The prompt `(hbnb)` indicates you are in the HBnB console. The interpreter supports:

- Creating, updating, showing, and deleting objects
- Displaying all objects or filtering by class
- Advanced syntax for method-like commands
